These are the localization files used by the indie game Time Turned: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877110/Time_Turned/.

I (Wyatt Senalik) localized the entirety of the game from English into Japanese. This repo is meant to give examples of the localization work I am capable.

Some notes for browing the CSV files:
Line breaks are represented by the | character. Commans are represented by the ; character.
The conversation CSV may be a bit confusing to view, because the way the game handles dialogue often means a single dialogue is broken up into multiple entries in the table. This was done to specify which parts of the dialogue would be have special effects applied to them or if parts of dialogue were references to frequently used proper nouns (like a character name).
